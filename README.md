A dedicated style guide for HTML


## Rules:
1. Avoid div-itis and use new HTML tags such as (header, footer, aside, article, section)

## Tags:

Use the HTML <button> element when ever you are linking to elements (not content) on the same page when 
you are not using anchor tags to link to content. This is ideally used when opening up modals, dialogs.

```html
<button>Your Button</button>
```


## Attributes:
### alt=''
All images which are using the <img> tag should use the alt attribute. If not alternative is provided, it is still 
recommened to use the alt attribute but with an empty string.
